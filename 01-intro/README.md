## Assignments for next lecture

### Design wireframes for Movie App

Use https://www.themoviedb.org as a data source. App must be able to:

* Show list of
  * most popular movies
  * now playing movies
* Search movie by name
* Show movie detail including
  * basic info (name, image, year)
  * actors
  * images/trailers
  * reviews
* Search for actor by name
* Show actor detail including
  * basic info (name, age, picture)
  * movies
* Handle login and display user profile
* Show list of user's favourite movies
* Add movie to favourites

And remember, you will need to implement what you design!
